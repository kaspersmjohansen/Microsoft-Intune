Description: 'We built ProtonVPN with extra security features to make it better at
  protecting your privacy than an ordinary VPN.

  When you use ProtonVPN to browse the web, your Internet connection is encrypted.

  By routing your connection through encrypted tunnels, ProtonVPNs advanced security
  features ensure that an attacker cannot eavesdrop on your connection.

  It also allows you to access websites that might be blocked in your country.'
ShortDescription: High-speed Swiss VPN that safeguards your privacy.
