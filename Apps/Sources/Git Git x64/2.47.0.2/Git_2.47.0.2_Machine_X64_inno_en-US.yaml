ReleaseNotes: 'Changes since Git for Windows v2.47.0 (October 8th 2024)

  Bug Fixes

  - A regression in v2.47.0 where git maintenance start crashed immediately was fixed.

  - A regression where clones, fetches and pushes via SSH would dead-lock was fixed.

  - As of Git for Windows v2.47.0, Scalar was supposed to enable an optimized push
  algorithm, but for a typo didn''t, which was fixed.

  - A few documentation and other, minor bug fixes from upstream Git were integrated
  into Git for Windows early.'
